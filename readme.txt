📌 Project Overview

MedTrackFit is a community-driven health recovery platform designed to make healing affordable and guided.

It connects:

🤕 Sufferer Patients

💚 Recovered Patients

🧭 Health Mentors

🧑‍⚕️ Doctors

The platform ensures that patients receive structured recovery support, real-life experience guidance, and professional supervision when required.
